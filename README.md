# Utilities

Some useful scripts/etc to have on hand.

## Scripts

`htail.sh`
- This is used to highlight log files using _awk_ for DEBUG/INFO/ERROR
- Set an alias for this with:
```sh
alias htail="./htail.sh"
```

`brightnessLevel.sh`
- Controller for the screen brightness of a Toshiba Chromebook running Linux
- Wrote this to bind to manually set brightness or increment/decrement on bound function key
